# Step 1: Create a directory and move into it
mkdir dac_demo && cd dac_demo

# Step 2: Create a file
echo "confidential" > confidential.txt

# Step 3: Restrict access (owner read/write only)
chmod 600 confidential.txt

# Step 4: Add a new user named alice
sudo adduser alice
# Follow the prompts to set alice’s password and info

# Step 5: Change ownership of the file to alice
sudo chown alice:alice confidential.txt

sudo chmod 711 /home/harshala  

# 5.2: Make the project folder group‐accessible and owner‐only writable  
sudo chmod 750 /home/harshala/dac_demo  

# Step 6: Switch to user alice
su - alice

# Step 7: Try reading the file
cat /home/your_original_user/dac_demo/confidential.txt
# Replace `your_original_user` with your actual username

ANOTHER WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
# Step 1: As user 'smruti', create a shared directory
mkdir /tmp/dac_demo
cd /tmp/dac_demo

# Step 2: Create a file and add some content
echo "Confidential content only for Alice" > file.txt

# Step 3: Set permission to allow only the owner to read/write
chmod 600 file.txt

# Step 4: Change ownership to user 'alice'
sudo chown alice:alice file.txt

# Step 5: Now switch to user 'alice'
su - alice

# Step 6: Try to read the file (now as alice)
cat /tmp/dac_demo/file.txt
