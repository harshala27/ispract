# 1. Create the group (note: plural “managers”)
sudo groupadd managers

# 2. Create the user “alice”
sudo adduser alice
# → follow prompts

# 3. Add alice to the “managers” group (group name plural!)
sudo usermod -aG managers alice

# 4. Create the file, writing your message into it
echo "managers only" > manager.txt

# 5. Make the file owned by the managers group
sudo chown :managers manager.txt

# 6. Give owner & group full rights; no rights for others
sudo chmod 770 manager.txt

# 7. Set the directory’s group ownership and perms so only you + managers can access
#    (replace “youruser” with your actual username)
sudo chown youruser:managers /home/youruser
sudo chmod 750      /home/youruser

# 8. (Re-login for group changes to take effect)
wsl --shutdown      # restart WSL


su - alice           # note the space after “su”
groups               # should list “managers”
cat /home/youruser/manager.txt   # should succeed

sudo adduser bob
su - bob
cat /home/youruser/manager.txt
